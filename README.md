# CrossPath
My implementation of CrossPath (puzzle game from Linedoku)

This game was made on a road trip from Ottawa to Columbus, OH. It was developed using Java and the Processing IDE, allowing for simple GUI drawing

Run cross_path.exe under application.windows64 to play the game.

There are two levels, which are similar to the game's levels.


Level design is not mine, nor is the game idea.
